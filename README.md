## Contribute

In order to check the web site on your local computer before you send your contribution you'll need to

install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Then you need to install [vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) and all the other dependencies using:

```
npm install
```

and run the web server locally:

It will compile the site, start a small server, and let you know that you can view the site at http://localhost:8080/
